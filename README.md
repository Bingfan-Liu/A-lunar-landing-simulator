### A simulated lunar landing agent using Expected Sarsa with Neural Network and Experience Replay

This is a final course project that I did in Reinforcement Learning Specialization offered by the University of Alberta and Coursera.



And I appreciate the help from Mr. Ganesh for creating this nice looking workflow plot.

Illustration about the methods for calculating the gradient: get_TD_update(self, s, delta_mat)
Here, the action value, a, used in the illustration is denoted by v(a,s) in the text book.
